    <h1>Happy birthday Esme!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Happy 15th birthday, you are almost at high school in just a few months youll be graduating and will be experiencing a time where many will be depressed, at their lowest. You are a wonderful person and i do wish that you dont experience something similar to that, like i said in discord im not very good at this at all im not really good at making this type of stuff.

        Sorry if the website isnt good, i did it in a very short time frame i was confused as to what the theme should be, i thought that a website themed around planets would be cool i had a very cool idea but i tried making it and i didnt know how to make it work, thats also why i asked if you liked astrology lol. i wasnt sure what saturn message will be so i decided that itll be better if i wrote something directly from my heart instead of googling what each planets represents. I wanted to do fictional planets but i couldnt find any high quality images of them so i just decided on real life planets. Sorry if im talking too much its because i want you to know my thought process when making this, im sure someone else could have done better but i hope you like it!. <br>
        Happy birthday! <br>-Maja
